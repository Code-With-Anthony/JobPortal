## Job Portal - MERN Stack, TypeScript, Redux, and More

This is a comprehensive job portal built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and enhanced with TypeScript for type safety and better code management. The application provides a seamless experience for job seekers and employers, offering advanced features like authentication, real-time notifications, and protected routes.

### Key Features:
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure user authentication using JWT tokens, with role-based access control (e.g., employer vs. job seeker).
- **Protected Routes**: Restricted access to certain routes based on user roles and authentication status.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Get instant updates on job application status, new job postings, and other relevant notifications in real-time.
- **Material UI & Tailwind CSS**: Combines Material UI for polished, professional design components and Tailwind CSS for utility-first custom styling.
- **Redux for State Management**: A global state management system using Redux to manage and persist user and job-related data across the application.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Ensures type safety and reduces errors in the development process by using TypeScript in both front-end and back-end code.
  
### Features for Job Seekers:
- **Create & Manage Profiles**: Users can create and edit profiles, upload resumes, and apply to job postings.
- **Job Search**: Filter job listings based on location, role, salary range, and more.
- **Job Applications**: Apply to job postings with ease, track application status, and receive real-time updates.

### Features for Employers:
- **Post & Manage Job Listings**: Employers can post new job openings, edit existing listings, and view applicants.
- **Application Management**: Review applications, shortlist candidates, and communicate with applicants directly through the platform.
- **Message Applicatnt**: This Feature is under consideration and soon going to be integrated.

### Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Redux, Material UI, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT Authentication
- **Real-Time Updates**: Socket.io for real-time notifications and communication.

This project is designed to be highly scalable, secure, and easy to maintain, with an intuitive interface for both job seekers and employers.
